Mappy
=====

Mappy is a modern map editor for Total Annihilation, seeking to replace the current community favourite, Annihilator.

Here are some of the current advantages:
* Undo and redo support
* Ability to move placed features around
* No need to "compress" maps to remove duplicate tiles
* Scroll wheel support
* Less weird bugs (e.g. the bug where features are not properly removed)

How to Use Mappy
----------------

Mappy is distributed as-is in a zip archive without an installer. Extract the archive to a folder of your choice and run Mappy.exe to launch the program.

When you first run Mappy, no map tilesets or features will be available. First, you should tell Mappy where they are. Go to Edit -> Preferences and add the directories that your tilesets and features live in to Mappy's search paths. The next time Mappy starts it will automatically load any tilesets and features it finds in those places.

The rest is up to you. Create a new map or load an existing one, drag and drop tiles and features from the sidebar, and edit your map's settings.

Known Issues
------------

* Contour lines will not display on newly placed sections until the map is saved and reopened.
* Saving a map takes quite a long time and freezes Mappy until it has finished.

Future Improvements
-------------------

In no particular order, here's a list of features that Mappy might one day support:

* Annihilator-like tools to select and move areas
* Copying and pasting sections and features
* Rendering high quality minimaps
* Anything Annihilator already does that's cool

and possibly more.
